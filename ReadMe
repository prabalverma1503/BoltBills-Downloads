🚀 What's New in BoltBills v2.0.0
This is a major update focusing on inventory accuracy, vendor management, and flexibility. We have completely overhauled how bills and stock interact.

✨ Key Features
1. Full Bill Editing

Edit Saved Bills: You no longer need to delete and recreate a bill if you make a mistake. You can now open existing bills, modify items, quantities, or prices, and save changes instantly.

2. Smart Inventory Management

Automatic Stock Deduction: When a bill is generated, the item quantity is now automatically deducted from your global stock.

Vendor Stock Updates: When you add a purchase entry in the Vendor section, the stock for those items is automatically added to your inventory.

3. Vendor Ledger System

Track Vendor Dues: Introduced a dedicated Vendor Ledger. You can now track purchase history, payments made, and outstanding balances for all your suppliers.

4. Enhanced User Experience

Keyboard Shortcuts: Added new hotkeys to speed up your workflow (e.g., quick save, new bill navigation).

UI Overhaul: Significant visual improvements and a cleaner layout to make navigation smoother and more intuitive.
